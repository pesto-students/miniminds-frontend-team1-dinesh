# Technology Stack

During our experimentation with unfamiliar technologies, we opted for a contemporary tech stack. As a result, we were able to develop a web application that boasts impressive speed, performance, and scalability. Our approach is designed to ensure that the application is well-suited to upcoming challenges in the next few years. To accomplish this, we utilized:

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Hasura](https://hasura.io/products/)
- [Postgres](https://hasura.io/graphql/database/postgresql/)
- [JWT](https://jwt.io/)
